# HOA Foreclosures

To investigate HOA foreclosures in North Carolina, reporters for The Charlotte Observer and The News and Observer used state courts data to examine thousands of foreclosure cases, as well as the paper court files for more than 100 cases in Mecklenburg and Wake counties. Their work is the first comprehensive analysis of HOA foreclosures in North Carolina.

Reporters also interviewed six people who lost their homes to foreclosure and more than 30 others, including attorneys who represent both HOAs and homeowners. A reporter also observed a foreclosure auction at the Mecklenburg County courthouse.

Reporters obtained and analyzed a North Carolina Administrative Office of the Courts database of all civil cases from January, 2018 to June, 2023 to identify HOA-related cases. 

We discovered that 50,000 liens were filed by nearly 6,000 HOAs. In roughly 11 percent of those cases, HOAs ultimately started foreclosure proceedings.
